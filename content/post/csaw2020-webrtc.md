# Web RTC (450pts) 39 solves #

![TASK](https://imgur.com/KJrEEZl.png)

Last weekend,we have been a part  of the CSAW CTF 2020 and our team Fword ranked 4th in MENA region.
We managed to solve all web challenges with my awesome teammates [@Hera](https://twitter.com/Hera14165735) and [@Noxious](https://twitter.com/BahaBaghdadi) and we have particularly enjoyed **Web RTC** .

## TL;DL ##

* Exploiting CoTurn server in order to gain SSRF.

* Escalating SSRF to RCE using Redis.

## Overview ##

We have a Real Time Chat web app and we were provided with the source code / Dockerfile / supervisor.conf.

![TASK](https://imgur.com/cBI0d2H.png)

Examining the source code didn't really bring something to the table.But we got some juicy stuff ,reading the Dockerfile / supervisor.conf.
It turned out that the application is using TURN protocol to relay the network traffic between peers and Redis as a caching system.

## Exploitation ##

Since the application didn't seem vulnreable, we decide to focus basically on CoTURN server exploitation.
After searching around we found the following [HackerOne report](https://hackerone.com/reports/333419) which claims that it's possible to abuse the TURN Protocol to gain SSRF. In fact,
the attacker may proxy TCP connections to the internal network by setting the **XOR-PEER-ADDRESS** of the TURN connect message (method 0x000A, https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6062#section-4.3) to a private IPv4 address.

We used the following **[tool](https://github.com/staaldraad/turner)** to exploit that issue.

We can notice that the Coturn server IP is returned to confirm the SSRF.

Unfortunately fetching localhost ip didn't work for us so we fired up wireshark to monitor the STUN (TURN Protocol is an extension of STUN protocol) packets.

![TASK](https://imgur.com/PmES4dZ.png)

We can confirm that the coTurn server has some protections blacklisting local ips. We first tried to bruteforce the internal ip but in vain , finally we managed  to bypass this protection 
using **0.0.0.0** ip:

And Bingo we achieved the first part!

### Escalating SSRF to RCE using Redis ##

This part was somehow trivial but it took us some time to exploit Redis properly, we used  some instructions from this **[tool](https://github.com/jas502n/Redis-RCE)** ( we fired a Rogue server from it) and executed the following commands:

And Voilaa We got our beloved flag :D It was our first time dealing with RTC website and exploiting and it was really fun!
